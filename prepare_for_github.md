# Prepare for GitHub Push

Since I cannot directly access Git operations, here are the steps you need to follow to push this project to GitHub:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com and create a new repository
2. Name it "face-attendance-system" or similar
3. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

## 2. Add Files to Git

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit: Face Attendance System with Flask and PostgreSQL"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/face-attendance-system.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 4. Next Steps After Push

1. **Set up environment variables** on your deployment platform
2. **Install dependencies** using the command in `dependencies.txt`
3. **Configure database** connection string
4. **Set up Twilio** for SMS notifications (optional)

## 5. Current Status

The basic system is working with:

The face recognition features are ready but may need dependency installation on the target platform.
